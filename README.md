The Emergency Ventilator System is a simple yet effective prototype designed to simulate the working of a ventilator using an Arduino, a servo motor, an LCD display, and a buzzer. This system can help regulate breathing by adjusting airflow based on the patient’s breathing rate (BPM) and air volume intake. It is designed for medical emergency situations where automated breathing assistance is required.
 Automatic Ventilation – Adjusts breathing rate based on real-time inputs.
 Buzzer Alerts – Sounds an alarm in case of emergency conditions.
 LCD Display – Provides real-time BPM and volume readings.
 Portable and Low-Cost – Can be easily built using affordable components.
 Adjustable Parameters – Breathing rate and volume can be manually controlled.
